      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>My journey began with a deep curiosity for creativity and online business. I initially stepped into the world of eCommerce, where I learned the fundamentals of digital marketing, customer engagement, and brand building. Over time, I realized that design plays a huge role in how people connect with products and ideas — that’s where my passion for graphic design and UI/UX started growing.

      Currently, I’m pursuing ICS (Intermediate in Computer Science), and along with my studies, I’ve expanded my focus towards programming and full-stack web development. I’m now combining all my skills — from marketing and design to development — to create digital experiences that not only look great but also perform seamlessly.

      My goal is to keep learning, evolving, and helping businesses transform their vision from design to development with creativity, strategy, and technology.</p>
